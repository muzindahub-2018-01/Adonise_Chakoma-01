                        <h2>Background information</h2>
                            <p>Safari Farm Produce was formed on the 21th of March 2017 by two young enterprenuers named Terrance Mwakutuya and Adonise Chakoma. It was formed after these two guys discovered a need of eggs in the area they were living (Kuwadzana Phase 3) in the capital city of Zimbabwe. They began to buy large quantities of eggs from Irvine's company which was the leading supplying firm by the time and selling them at a mark up price in their area focusing retailers mainly. Surprisingly, the market responded very well up to an extend that they decided to start their own company,thats when they acquired a plot in Mvurwi, a small town in Zimbabwe where all the operations takes place.</p>
